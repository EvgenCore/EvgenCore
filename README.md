<h3 align="left">👩‍💻  About me : </h3>

###

<p align="left">I am an aspiring Frontend developer based in Barcelona, Spain. My journey into IT began with a Frontend course from Codecademy. I became very interested in the field of creating websites and web applications. During my self-study, I created numerous websites on various topics.
In early 2024, I enrolled in the Frontend Web Developer course from CodeOp and successfully completed it. This course provided a deeper dive into creating advanced web applications using Vue.js.
I am currently continuing to gain knowledge and develop websites.</p>
